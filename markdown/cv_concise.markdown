## Research interests

I study biogeochemistry and ecohydrology, particularly the effects of climate, global change, and disturbance on the structure, function, and distribution of terrestrial ecosystems. I use geospatial data, process-based models, micrometeorology, stable isotopes, and other methods with the chief aim of understanding the earth system and informing the management and conservation of its resources.
