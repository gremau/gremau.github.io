## Current and past projects

- I'm joining [Environmental Data Initiative](https://edirepository.org) in Fall 2023
- Ecology, data science, and informatics at the [Jornada Basin LTER](https://lter.jornada.nmsu.edu) program
- Studying soil carbon cycling and impacts of solar power development in the Mojave Desert with UC Berkeley colleagues
- Ecohydrology research at the [New Mexico Elevation Gradient](http://www.litvaklab.org/new-mexico-elevation-gradient.html) cluster of [AmeriFlux](https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) sites
- [My dissertation research](http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/etd3/id/2901/rec/32) studying seasonally snow-covered ecosystems in the western U.S.

## Software

These are works in progress, but I welcome contributions and aim to make them useful to others.

* [sawyer](https://github.com/gremau/sawyer): Manage and quality assure data from dataloggers and environmental sensor networks
* [ecoflux](https://github.com/gremau/ecoflux): Compute and analyze ecosystem mass and energy fluxes and other environmental time series
