## Research and professional interests

I am a broadly-trained ecologist and environmental data scientist aiming to understand Earth's changing ecosystems, and to inform critical resource management and conservation efforts. My primary research interests are in the biogeochemistry and ecohydrology of drylands, particularly the effects of climate, global change, and disturbance on vegetation and soil systems. I wear many professional hats, including data analyst, data manager, co-PI, programmer, instructor, and working-group leader. I enjoy collaborating with diverse teams, am technologically savvy, and approach my work with an open-science philosophy.
