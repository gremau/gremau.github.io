## Research and professional interests

I am a broadly trained ecologist with well-developed quantitative and informatics skills. My research interests are in terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecohydrology, particularly the effects of climate, global change, and disturbance on vegetation and soil systems. As a data analyst and data manager I'm competent using a wide variety of methods and technologies to create, communicate, and publish impactful research products with an open-science philosophy. My professional goals are to understand and raise awareness of the changing earth and its ecosystems, and to inform critical resource management and conservation efforts.
