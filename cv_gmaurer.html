<h2 id="research-and-professional-interests">Research and professional interests</h2>
<p>I am a broadly trained ecologist with well-developed quantitative and informatics skills. As a scientist I investigate terrestrial biogeochemistry and ecohydrology, particularly the effects of climate, global change, and disturbance on vegetation and soil systems. As a data analyst and data manager I’m competent using a wide variety of methods and technologies to create, communicate, and publish impactful research under an open-science philosophy. My chief professional aims are to understand, and raise awareness of, the earth and its ecosystems, and to inform critical resource management and conservation efforts.</p>
