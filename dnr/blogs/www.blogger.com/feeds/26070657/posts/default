Land is cheap out there on the internet these days. If you visit my domain, which is called www.primaryproductivity.org, at this exact moment you will find nothing substantive, just some links and ads from GoDaddy.com (the registrar that I purchased my name from) that serve as a kind of placeholder until I get a host and some of my own content built there. I don't know what I'll do in this domain. Probably I'll start posting my work there - so these blogs will probably move over there eventually, and hopefully a new blog on my graduate research experiences will develop, and I can keep interesting electronic media and info there for people to access. I hope it will all come together as something interesting over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The name.... is dorky, but I like it, and if you don't like it you should stop and think about this: Primary productivity is defined as the movement of carbon from the atmosphere into living organisms over time. Essentially, it is the rate of photosynthesis, and 99% of all life on earth depends on the products of this directly or indirectly. This process is performed mainly by vascular plants on land and by algae in the oceans. You, and all the other beings that grow and reproduce by eating plants and other animals are another result of primary productivity. So, what I'm saying here is that this blog is about YOU. And me. Its about &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;us&lt;/span&gt;.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2007/11/i-am-master-of-my-domain.html' title='I am the master of my domain'/><link rel='related' href='http://www.primaryproductivity.org' title='I am the master of my domain'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=96569256936500591&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/96569256936500591/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/96569256936500591'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/96569256936500591'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-7415876037375648619</id><published>2007-11-07T18:06:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2007-11-07T18:09:03.610-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The metabolic theory of ecology...</title><content type='html'>...is cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really cool.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2007/11/metabolic-theory-of-ecology.html' title='The metabolic theory of ecology...'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=7415876037375648619&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/7415876037375648619/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/7415876037375648619'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/7415876037375648619'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-801864217450091145</id><published>2007-10-16T16:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-10-16T17:39:28.251-07:00</updated><title type='text'>My life is over, but I will continue to blog about it</title><content type='html'>I have yet again postponed real life to become a student for several more years, this time a "graduate student" at the University of Utah. I'm joining an &lt;a href="http://www.biology.utah.edu/bowling/index.html"&gt;ecosystem ecology lab&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on studying biosphere-atmosphere interactions, the carbon cycle at multiple scales, and blah blah pollution blah feedbacks to blah-bla isotopic blablablah climate change bla-blah blah blablah. I don't know specifically what part of this research I'll be latching on to and developing into a thesis project yet, but as long as I keep sitting at my desk reading journal articles, gazing blankly out the window, reading some more, thinking about the metabolic theory of ecology, staring at the ceiling, reading all this weeks Nature articles that apply to my field, sending emails to professors, pondering, going to get coffee and then coming back to my desk for more reading, thinking, making lists of papers to read, staring, and so on, as I am currently doing almost every day of the week, I'll probably come up with something good in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what does that mean for this blog? I don't really know. I'll sit at my desk and think about it. One thing I do know is that I like this blog and I want to keep writing here, or at least continue writing in the same vein - that is, writing creatively about the things I do on a daily basis while bringing up the scientific thinking and processes behind it in a clear and interesting way. It helps me explain things to myself (and possibly others) and prevents me from getting desperately bored with my life in academia. I also like posting pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One idea I have is to give this blog a makeover and turn it into my graduate student blog. I could archive the seed collecting blog posts somewhere, rearrange the links, change the title, make a few other minor adjustments, and then continue my blogging career. I could also just orphan this one and start a completely new blog. I don't know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, here is a picture of an old broken-down truck sitting in a field at the &lt;a href="http://entrada.utah.edu/"&gt;Entrada field station&lt;/a&gt;, a new U of U research facility on the Dolores river that I visited last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GXjpWAjxWHA/RxVYgxSrcsI/AAAAAAAAACM/7_P095HhRmo/s1600-h/Entrada_070030.jpeg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp1.blogger.com/_GXjpWAjxWHA/RxVYgxSrcsI/AAAAAAAAACM/7_P095HhRmo/s320/Entrada_070030.jpeg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5122097471214547650" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2007/10/my-life-is-over-but-i-will-continue-to.html' title='My life is over, but I will continue to blog about it'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=801864217450091145&amp;isPopup=true' title='4 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/801864217450091145/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/801864217450091145'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/801864217450091145'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-1477109826992987323</id><published>2007-05-24T19:32:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2007-05-24T19:49:22.725-07:00</updated><title type='text'>So...Matthew has his own blog now.

How could you forget? I never will. It is the most beautiful, the most elusive, the most sought after, the most frustrating plant in the world. &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polygala subspinosa&lt;/span&gt; is my dream plant. And my nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first met &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polygala subspinosa&lt;/span&gt; at my Temple Mountain camp while looking at some &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Eriogonums&lt;/span&gt; and stuff. One morning, I walked around the corner of a Pinion pine and there were two very small, very beautiful plants with purple and yellow blossoms unfurling in the morning sun. That was all I needed to become completely obsessed. I spent the remainder of the summer criss-crossing the state, scrawled herbarium notes in hand, mumbling fuzzy map coordinates to myself, searching like a junkie for that one population that would go to Kew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never found more than half a dozen plants in one place. I would drive 50 miles out of my way, then scramble like a lemur all over an entire valley or mountainside to find one plant. One lone, beautiful plant. Taunting me. Holding those remarkable blossoms proudly above the thorny green mound below. It happened over and over and I became an utter mess. My friends stopped talking to me, my parents wrote me out of the will, I lost 30 pounds and hardly slept at all. When I finally hit rock bottom I had been dragging a plant press through the Wah Wah Mountains for 4 days without food or water and then collapsed face down in a pile of cow manure. A rancher saved me from suffocating to death and then talked some sense into me in that way that only a range-worn cowboy can. His leathery lips were glued shut most of the time, but when he chose to speak it was through complicated metaphors about the cattle, the range, the changing of seasons. It was deep, and I still don't completely understand all of what he said, but eventually I straightened out and gathered up the pieces of my shattered life, vowing never to lay eyes on another &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polygala subspinosa&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But today everything changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone named Deb, the Capitol Reef NP botanist, contacted me after seeing &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Polygala subspinosa&lt;/span&gt; on my Seeds of Success list. She told me about a population that she's seen in a place called Miner's Mountain. It should be blooming soon.

Next year can be the Year of Compositae. Perhaps the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Daleas&lt;/span&gt; in 2009?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is official, I will be running a Utah Seeds of Success team again this year. I am excited, but field work is a long ways off. Today I went to work at the GIS lab, which tragically has not a single window to the outdoors, and I still found my brow dripping with perspiration because I was fantasizing on wandering through the desert, squeezing swelling buds, watching corollas part their lips to the desert breeze, nectar glistening in the morning sun, insects weaving drunkenly through the air laden with pollen grains. I am in an ecstatic dreamlike state. A transcendental walking meditation on native plants. And who will I wander the fields of flowers with this year? Maybe you dear reader... I am looking for a crack team of volunteers who are aroused by plant reproduction, the conservation thereof, and good human comeraderie in the wild west. Contact me if you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is the teaser for the next post: Its not even close to spring yet and most plants will be lying patiently dormant under a blanket of snow for at least a few months yet, so I will have to content myself with dreaming and doing research. To start, I'll be doing a little reading on &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Eriogonum&lt;/span&gt; - one of Utah's most diverse and beautiful plant genera. At this address you will soon find a brief treatise on the evolution and phylogeny of this group of plants to whet your whistle for the field season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yours, etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GXjpWAjxWHA/RbBoatsq8XI/AAAAAAAAAA0/y66B9uHN01I/s1600-h/Roancliffs.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://bp2.blogger.com/_GXjpWAjxWHA/RbBoatsq8XI/AAAAAAAAAA0/y66B9uHN01I/s400/Roancliffs.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5021628392670949746" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Somewhere in the Roan Cliffs&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2007/01/thus-begins-year-of-buckwheat.html' title='Thus begins the Year of the Buckwheat'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=1613937082598409357&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/1613937082598409357/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/1613937082598409357'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/1613937082598409357'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-116207324090450249</id><published>2006-10-28T14:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-11-13T18:49:48.583-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Current affairs at PVHD</title><content type='html'>Dear readers,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post to this site occasionally over the winter, but my work with Red Butte Garden is on a seasonal break until we renew the Seeds of Success project next spring.

It is a striking, magical little being that lives along seeps and waterfalls. We had a harrowing day finding it, but it all ended up being worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my journal entries for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/IMG_0719.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/400/IMG_0719.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;7:00 am:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;It is a beautiful, sunny August morning in Big Cottonwood Canyon. The survey crew of 7 of the most eminent  botanists in the region has assembled at the base of the trial to Lake Blanch and there is animated discussion and convivial laugther while we drink our morning coffee and prepare to embark on our grand adventure in search of the rare and beautiful &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dodecatheon utahensis&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;12:00 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reaching the lake we split into 3 search parties and begin searching crevices and seeping overhangs in the quartzite cliff bands descending from the Sundial into the lake. After much searching there is still no sign of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dodecatheon&lt;/span&gt;. Our energy is diminished, but spirits remain high and there is optimistic banter about finding our plant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;2:00 pm: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still nothing, and there are now some good natured arguments over routfinding and debates on what search areas to take on in order to make the most of the day. Rations are running low and some members of the crew begin to mention their afternoon engagements. Overall the mood is good though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;2:45pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Half of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dodecatheon&lt;/span&gt; search party turns back. The rest of us try to keep a positive attitude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;3:30 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has become quite hot this afternoon and most of our water bottles are dry. There is more grumbling among the crew. Someone cracks a joke about mutiny. Uncomfortable laughter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;4:25 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crew is now exhausted and patience is at an end. Some crew members are audibly and openly discussing mutiny. For my part, I have a swollen tongue, a cottony mouth, and am feeling very weary. I'm ready to give up. Someone mentions that Mr. David Compton parted with the group a while back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;4:45 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Compton has been missing for some 30 minutes now. Our search has left us emptyhanded, impatient, and dehydrated by this point and skeptics among us have now decided that the element occurrence that we are trying to verify was mistaken and that we are now on a wild goose chase with one unaccounted-for botanist already and more on the way if we don't turn around. There is also a faction of the group expressing frustration for Mister Compton and at some point the consensus becomes that he must be taught a lesson about "not being a douche and staying with the group" The crew makes plans to desert without him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;4:46 pm: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Compton is sighted high above the crew, just beneath Sundial peak. He is gibbering unintelligibly and seems to be gesturing for the rest of the crew to hike up 1000 more vertical feet to join him. This is fiercely debated and there are violent outbursts among the crew. Threats and accusations fly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;5:05 pm: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After much argument and some minor scuffling among the crew, the decision is made to hike up to meet Mr. Compton. If he has duped us into climbing  this far with no sign of &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dodecatheon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;utahensis&lt;/span&gt; he will surely be lyched. The crew reluctantly begins the long trek up to the Sundial. There are periodic violent outbursts and many more complaints of dehydration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;5:35 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exhausted, we reach Mr. Compton. He is grinning (in a somewhat oversatisfied manner in my opinion) and has found a striking population of the &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Dodecatheon&lt;/span&gt; perched high in a seeping overhang. The evening sun glistens on the tiny streams of water descending down the rock. We rejoice, collect all our field notes and site metrics, and then take a few pictures of the newest known population of Dodecatheon utahensis. As the crags across the canyon become bathed in whiskey colored light, we wrap up, pat each other on the backs, and head back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;7:15 pm:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crew retires to the Brighton Village Store and is rewarded by the orgnizer of this expedition with one 12 oz. beer each for their efforts. It is noted that this amounts to less than one ounce per hour of searching during the day. Laughter and much rejoicing follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/IMG_0727.0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/400/IMG_0727.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2006/09/dodecatheon-utahensis-expedition-year.html' title='&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dodecatheon utahensis&lt;/span&gt; expedition - Year of Our Lord 2006'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=115886193026943773&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/115886193026943773/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115886193026943773'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115886193026943773'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-115690321198327694</id><published>2006-08-29T18:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-08-29T19:08:24.013-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Former glory</title><content type='html'>This blog will soon be restored to it's former glory and influence.

I was referring, in part, to our lovely &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0344.jpg"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Poliomintha incana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; species. And though that plant may elude us as a Millenium Seed Bank species due to lackluster seed production and a lack of manpower this year, I still think it is important to talk about why &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Poliomintha incana&lt;/span&gt; and other sand stabilizing plants are becoming so intriguing in these crazy times that we live in. So, gather all your tender minds around the monitor - its time for the POVHAD blog to teach you some stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the aforementioned post I posted a link to an &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5415315" target="_blank"&gt;NPR feature on windblown dust&lt;/a&gt; in the Southwest. The feature talked about how, particularly in Utah, airborne dust is on the rise due to the decline of biotic soil crusts. These soil crusts, which stabilize large areas of fine textured soils in Utah, are in decline mainly due to human activites such as ORV use and grazing activity, and the resulting increases in blowing dust has a variety of problematic consequences. (&lt;a href="http://www.soilcrust.org/" target="_blank"&gt;USGS soil crust site&lt;/a&gt;). Well, a close relative of windblown dust, is windblown sand, and as I was taking cowardly refuge in my pickup truck during a severe San Rafael Desert sandstorm I was inspired to learn more about windblown sand and the plant communities growing in this sandblasted ecosystem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0544.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/200/img_0544.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Unknown, San Rafael Desert.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the purpose of this discussion, let's talk about what is needed to make sand dunes, and then define two types of sand dunes. The two critical factors that make dunes possible are a plentiful source of sand, and strong, frequent winds to blow the sand. There are many geologic formations that weather into sand, (usually sandstones) and no shortage of wind in many parts of the arid West, making this a good place for dunes. The first type of dunes are active sand dunes - large areas of windblown (or eolian) sands that are actively moving. Though such dunes may not appear to move, perhaps remaining in a natural depression like a valley, the sand nevertheless moves with each wind storm to form fresh patterns and features in the dunes. The physical aspects of active sand dune formation and movement are &lt;a href="http://www.nps.gov/whsa/Sand%20Dune%20Geology.htm" target="_blank"&gt;discussed here&lt;/a&gt;. In an active dune environment, the constant churning of sand allows little chance for vegetation to establish and makes these areas unsuitable for human habitation, agriculture and grazing. The second dune type - stabilized dunes -  are large areas of surface sand, often in sheets, that are not actively moving or changing shape, at least not on a large scale. The reason for these dunes' stability is that they support the growth of vegetation. Not just little annuals either, but strongly rooted perennials and shrubs. Though the wind may blow, the plants that grow here can hold on and anchor a well developed community of organisms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Active dunes are common in the the Sonoran, Mojave, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America, but with a few &lt;a href="http://www.desertusa.com/coralut/corut.html" target="_blank"&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;, there aren't many active sand dunes on the Colorado Plateau. This is in spite of the fact that places like the San Rafael Desert have both an abundant source of sand - the layercake sandstones of the region thrust out of the ground everywhere - and reliable strong winds. I have rarely visited Hanksville or Moab without griping for at least a few hours in stiff to howling winds. However, the dunes here are almost always stabilized by vegetation. The difference, as you might have guessed, is moisture. The &lt;a href="http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/Change/modern_climatic_conditions.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Colorado Plateau&lt;/a&gt; recieves just slightly more moisture than the &lt;a href="http://helios.bto.ed.ac.uk/bto/desertecology/northame.htm#top" target="_blank"&gt;deserts mentioned above&lt;/a&gt;, allowing plants to gain a solid foothold in the sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0551.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0551.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;I counted eleven unique insect species on this one milkweed plant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dunes of the San Rafael Desert are stabilized by a diverse community of beautiful and unique plants and it is well worth a visit during the spring or early summer. In addition, there is a huge diversity of insects and larger wildlife such as lizards, rabbits, prarie dogs, and pronghorn antelope. A few of the interesting plants you might find there:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Amsonia tomentosa&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;a href="http://www.calflora.net/bloomingplants/woollyamsonia.html" target="_blank"&gt;Wooly Amsonia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Artemisia filifolia - &lt;/span&gt;Old man sagebrush&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Quercus welshii&lt;/span&gt; - a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;gambellii/turbinella&lt;/span&gt; hybrid that stabilizes dunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Ephedra sp.&lt;/span&gt; - Mormon tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Wyethia scabra&lt;/span&gt; - Rough mulear sunflower&lt;br /&gt;A wild assortment of Milkweeds, Flax, Phacelia, Asters, Globemallows, Astragalus, Lupine, Penstemon, and Sand verbenas.&lt;br /&gt;And of course our lovely &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Poliomintha incana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, asking what the future holds for a stabilized dune ecosystem that recieves only a fraction more moisture on average than nearby active dune ecosystem seems like a relevant question to ask, especially in the era of human caused climate change. The USGS seems to think that there is a potential for large areas of stable dunes in the southwest to become active again, perhaps rendering large sections of Navajo and Hopi land in the Four Corners region uninhabitable (&lt;a href="http://geochange.er.usgs.gov/sw/impacts/geology/sand/" target="_blank"&gt;USGS site&lt;/a&gt;.) According to them, even a slight drying of the climate might make plant communities such as the one in the San Rafael Desert recede, leaving large tracts of active dunes. Such a phenomenon is already a part of widespread desertification happening in &lt;a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/000252.html" target="_blank"&gt;northern China&lt;/a&gt;, Hopefully, we will be able to manage such a crisis before it gets so bad, and learning more about dune stabilizing plants might be a small part of that. Incidentally, 2006 is the &lt;a href="http://www.iydd.org/" target="_blank"&gt;International Year of Deserts and Desertification&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;*  *  *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the sky turned a murky brown and I scrambledblindly into the truck I saw great clouds of sand, lit yellow from behind, rise out of the valley between Wild Horse Butte and the Reef. I watched all the shrubs and bunchgrasses rolling over under waves of wind, and then hunker down to the ground to endure a good sandblasting. My truck started to shake back and forth.

The male then clasps the female damselfly to his body and the two fly around in this coupled formation, often for several hours. In this time she curls her abdomen forward to pick up the male's sperm and fertilize her eggs. When mating is over, the pair may fly in tandem until the female can deposit eggs into aquatic vegetation or directly into the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couples I saw were too shy to land and let me take a picture to publish on the internet.</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2006/07/what-do-i-keep-in-my-long-slender.html' title='What do I keep in my long, slender, damselfly abdomen?'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=115225935328139880&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/115225935328139880/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115225935328139880'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115225935328139880'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-115225520596995059</id><published>2006-07-06T23:53:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-07-07T01:26:07.916-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Recent love affairs and plants we will admire from afar</title><content type='html'>*sigh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;botany, like other kinds of romance, can break your heart. we found these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0603.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0603.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Carex hoodii&lt;/span&gt; at daybreak on Trout Creek Ridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0519.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0519.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Claytonia lanceolata&lt;/span&gt;, Lanceleaf Spring Beauty.

But alas, it can be difficult to come up with witty stories and mind-boggling photographs on a regular basis, especially while assuming the herculean task of finding and collecting huge amounts of native plant seed in the far flung locales of the Beehive State. I hope that the unbelievably high quality of the individual posts will make up for the sometimes painfully long (for the reader) periods in between them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the subject of today's post:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew and I rocked the proverbial house last week on a two day collecting stint in the Swell. We collected another two members of &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Astragalus&lt;/span&gt; -&lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;praelongus&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;moencoppensis&lt;/span&gt;- for Kew, got a huge collection of Singleleaf ash for the Bend seed bank, and a somewhat disappointing collection from &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Poliomintha incana&lt;/span&gt;. The kicker though, was a whopping 10 collections that will go to the Red Butte Garden seed bank for trials. Granted, these are small collections and it wasn't that hard to get 10 done, but they are all fantastic species with great horticultural potential. With any luck you will be seeing them in the RB Gardens in the next few years. With even more luck, some may make it out of Red Butte Gardens and into the gardens of the world - maybe even yours - in the years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Here are a few of my faves for the trial program:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0362.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0362.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Linum puberulum, a beautiful, delicate little flax growing in open Pinion-Juniper table-lands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0310.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0310.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Eriogonum bicolor, Pretty buckwheat.

If 2007 is as favorable as I'm hoping it will be, I'd like to call it the "Year of the &lt;span style="font-style:italic;"&gt;Eriogonum&lt;/span&gt;." I think it would be great to have this become a tradition for everyone at Red Butte (at least), with a new genus introduced and celebrated with great fanfare every May. Perhaps there could even be a parade down the Floral Walk as the opening event for the plant sale or something. Will someone bring this up at the next staff meeting for me please?</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2006/06/trials-and-tribulations-of-field.html' title='Trials and tribulations of field botanists in the &quot;Year of the Astragalus&quot;'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=115146695970233759&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/115146695970233759/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115146695970233759'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115146695970233759'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-115087139237705123</id><published>2006-06-20T23:14:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-06-21T06:01:12.760-07:00</updated><title type='text'>This blog: Is it the future of the botanical media?</title><content type='html'>There has been much discussion lately about the emerging blogosphere's imminent role in revolutionizing "the news" and overtaking the "mainsteam media" as the public's main source of information about the world around them. Though we here at the "; plants of various habit and distribution........" blog elected NOT to attend the &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/09/washington/09cnd-bloggers.html?ex=1151035200&amp;en=e24c00e31e4c7c08&amp;amp;ei=5070" target="_blank"&gt;first annual meeting of the progressive blogosphere&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.yearlykos.org/" target="_blank"&gt;YearlyKos&lt;/a&gt; convention in Las Vegas, NV last week, we would nonetheless like to add our two cents to all the fuss. We see ourselves as martyrs for "the cause", and given the staggering growth in readership since our inception, we think the entire world will take note.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sense, we owe a debt of gratitude to the "mainstream media" for ignoring the key issues, such as &lt;a href="http://tncweeds.ucdavis.edu/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;invasive plant species&lt;/a&gt;, the phenomenon known as "&lt;a href="http://utahseeds.blogspot.com/2006/05/case-of-head-bonking-cows-revisited.html" target="_blank"&gt;locoweeds&lt;/a&gt;", human &lt;a href="http://www.centerforplantconservation.org/ASP/CPC_ViewProfile.asp?CPCNum=205" target="_blank"&gt;encroachment into native plant communities&lt;/a&gt;, and the effects of global warming (&lt;a href="http://scholar.google.com/url?sa=U&amp;q=http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/%7Ew3pkota/courses/bot1700/dukes%26mooney1999.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;) that are already being felt in ecosystems around the globe. Their ineptitude has opened a whole universe of crucial issues for us to report and offer carefully considered editorials on. Though we too will mourn the disappearance of current events printed on old fashioned dead plant fibers with (sometimes) soy derived inks, we hope that the tradeoff will be for accuracy in reporting on issues that matter to plants, and by association, all the organisms in this community that we know as Earth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You, our loyal readers, can rest assured knowing that this blog will continue take the lead in reporting most current, prescient, and accurate stories in the plant world.

Of course I had to find out the truth, and finding out if the place could somehow be productive for the Seeds of Success program was the perfect in. The truth about the &lt;a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/provo/desert_range/desert_range.shtml" target="_blank"&gt;Desert Experimental Range&lt;/a&gt;, which is not classified, secret, or scary in any way, is this: it is a 225 square km plot of land that has been set aside for range management and ecology research. The research done here can help improve land management techniques for the 200,000 square km of land in the Great Basin that are floristically and geologically similar to the DER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0466.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/200/img_0466.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Prunus fasciculata, Desert almond. Evidently, fruit production is rare here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The DER was set aside in 1933 by President Herbert Hoover. At this time, as the Great Depression was beginning, the public lands of the West and especially the Great Basin had been under intensive use for grazing for some time. This unmanaged use was beginning to take a toll on the landscape, the health of the plant communities, and the productivity of the region's livestock industry. Hoover set aside the DER as an "agricultural range experiment station" to encourage research into rangeland ecology of the Great Basin, and to develop more sustainable livestock practices. To this end, the DER was fenced by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) in 1935 and portions of the land were divided into various enclosures and exclosures so that grazing regimes and management techniques could be tested and the results observed on a long term basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sheep grazing studies began in the winter of 1934/1935 to study the economic and ecological impacts of grazing at different intensities, seasons, and frequencies. The core of those grazing treatments has been maintained each winter for 59 years. Cattle grazing was added later. Several permanent exclosures ranging in size from 0.4 to 740 ha (1.0 to 1828 acres) are scattered throughout the Desert Experimental Range on all plant community types permitting direct examination of the effects of grazing and nonuse." --from Desert Experimental Range publication, Stanley G.

The purpose of MAB reserves is to encourage research on how humankind interacts with its environment with goals of reducing biodiversity loss, improving livelihoods, and enhancing social, economic and cultural conditions for environmental                  sustainability.

Launched in the early 1970s, it notably targets the ecological,                social and economic dimensions of biodiversity loss and the reduction                of this loss.

Just returned from a brilliant 2 day trip to the Swell with some members of our fine RBG Volunteer Corps. Together we harvested 3 Kew collections - &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Astragalus rafaelensis, Astragalus woodruffi, &lt;/span&gt;and &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Gaillardia spathulata. &lt;/span&gt;Many thanks to Jenn, Jake, and Kevin for all the help out there under the unforgiving sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also got a smaller collection of &lt;a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0344.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Poliomintha incana&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;done, but we might have to try again later for a larger collection of this one. It has a lovely minty sage scent, making it a pleasure to collect, and outstanding horticultural potential, but it also has the difficult job of stabilizing sand dunes in a very windy area. Given this valuable ecological role and the ongoing process of climate change, it may be an increasingly important species to collect for restoration purposes. I'm going to put together an educational post about eolian (windblown) sand, vegetation, and climate change soon, but as a teaser, see this &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5415315" target="_blank"&gt;feature on dust in Utah&lt;/a&gt; from NPR. Hopefully all the Hoary Desert Rosemary-mint seed wont get sandblasted away in the next few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/img_0499.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/320/img_0499.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Astragalus woodruffii country, evening on the Trail of the Ancients&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2006/06/hot-harvest-while-sniffing-winds-of.html' title='A hot harvest, while sniffing the winds of change'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=115013312212673215&amp;isPopup=true' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/115013312212673215/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115013312212673215'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/115013312212673215'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-114973245796075517</id><published>2006-06-07T19:00:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-06-08T08:12:54.606-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Sidebar update!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/1600/imgp2293.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4587/2729/200/imgp2293.jpg" alt="" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Check it out!

In the seedling census now under way on Barro Colorado, young biologists doing the tallies bound like ocelots up the steep path above Laboratory Cove through an idyllic forest where howler monkeys dangle and orchid bees hover. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At other plots, stretched around the Equator like a belt, plot science takes on Indiana Jones dimensions. Deep in the forest, scientists can encounter tropical diseases, toxic ant bites, spitting cobras, smugglers and armed insurgents. More than one scientist from the forest center has had a close call.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/2006/06/plant-science-most-exciting-occupation.html' title='Plant science: the most exciting occupation on Earth?'/><link rel='related' href='http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/science/earth/06tree.html?pagewanted=1' title='Plant science: the most exciting occupation on Earth?'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=26070657&amp;postID=114961369876239407&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://blog.primaryproductivity.org/feeds/114961369876239407/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/114961369876239407'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/26070657/posts/default/114961369876239407'/><author><name>Greg</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/11511247372356785100</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email></author></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-26070657.post-114961181963676781</id><published>2006-06-06T08:35:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2006-06-06T09:42:43.433-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Great Basin wildflowers</title><content type='html'>Last week I took a trip out to the basin and range country of southwest Utah to look for plants. Here are a few photos from the Wah Wah mountains and Pine Valley -- not all are keyed out yet.
